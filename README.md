UVA CS 2110 Concurrency Assignment 

Defined in the [default package](src) are several abstract classes that define the backbone of an elevator system. You are to extend these abstract classes such that all the Persons are delivered safely to their destination floors. 

Start by making classes that will extend the abstract classes here. Your classes should be called: 
- Elevator 
- Button 
- ElevatorController 

Add method stubs in your concrete classes for each of the abstract methods, implement the Elevator ```start()``` method, and go from there. 

Detailed instructions are given in the comments in [Simulation.java](src/Simulation.java), [AbstractElevator.java](src/AbstractElevator.java), [AbstractButton.java](src/AbstractButton.java), and[AbstractElevatorController.java](src/AbstractElevatorController.java). Also, see the documentation [here](http://people.virginia.edu/~mtp4be/ElevatorHW/). We recommend that you read through and understand the provided code before jumping into coding.

You should not make any changes to the provided files except for testing purposes. We will test your submission by running your classes with our versions of the files, so any changes you make will not be preserved during grading. Your implementation must work with the provided code.
